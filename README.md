Personal study for Algorithm &amp; Data Structure
-------------------------------------------------

Book : "뇌를 자극하는 알고리즘"



Day 1
>Data Structure 'List' end. Single, double, circular.   
>List is good at that lots of add / delete / insert, less detection   
>e.g. At DB, dealing with records viewed sequentially.
>
Day 2
>Implement Double Linked List with C style   
>Basic.h is a collection of basic headers like stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.
>
Day 3
>Data Structure 'Stack' end.   
>Modify Double Linked List with C style   
>Implement Stack with two version.   
>First version is Stack using Array with C style   
>Second version is Stack using Single Linked List with C style

Day 4
>Data Structure 'Queue' end.   
>Queue is suitable for Queue processing.   
>Circular Queue has good performance, but hard to handle.   
>Linked Queue is easy to implement, but performance is slower than Circular Queue.   
>Implement Queue with two version.   
>First version is Circular Queue with array, C style.   
>Second version is Linked Queue with Single Linked List, C style.   
>For separation, change .cpp to .c file.

Day 5
>Data Structure 'Tree' half end.   
>The contents of the book are over, but it don't handle all of trees.   
>So I expressed 'half end'   
>I already know Binary Tree, but Left Child Right Sibling Tree is first got to know.   
>Implement LCRS Tree and Binary Tree with C style.
